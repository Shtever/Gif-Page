In this assignment, we used JQuery to call and receive information from the Giphy API.

The webpage should have a theme in whch the user can click theme-related buttons on the top of the page to display 10 gifs realted to the text on the button. The gifs animate when the user clicks on each of them.

The user also has the option of entering a word or phrase in the input section and clicks the "GIF SEARCH" button, after which the input will appear alongside the other buttons, and 10 gifs related to the input will appear with the same functionality.

At any time, the user can click through the buttons to generate 10 gifs, which will prepend on the page above previous gifs shown.
